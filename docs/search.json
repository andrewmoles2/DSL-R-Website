The image below shows the basic layout of a R Markdown document.\n\n\n\nImage of R Markdown notebook, indicating the text and code sections\n\n\nThere are three ways to run code in a code cell. The two ways mentioned in the image (Run and play button), and third is to use ctrl/command + Enter to run each like just like you would with an R script.\nThe most important thing for you to take note of is the code cells. Each code cell is like a small R script. Youâ€™ll notice the ``` markings around the code cell. It is important these do not get deleted, so be careful when editing your code!\nFinally, you can add your own code cell using option+command+i on a Mac or ctrl + alt + i on a Windows machine.\nThroughout the notebooks you will come across exercises, with empty code cells for you to type your code into. Your task is to test out the examples, then try and do the exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you have struggled with any of these steps, just come along to the workshops and ask a trainer for support"

A large part of this is due to R being designed to work with data, so it feels natural, and some of the excellent extensions that have been added to R over the years to make it more slick (great examples are the tidyverse and data.table packages).\nFurther, there are the vast amount of online resources in forms of tutorials, blogs, online courses, people sharing code/examples and help available through online discussion forums like stackoverflow and slack.\nSome of the best available resources to learn R are:\n\nR for Data Science book and the first edition is still great\nR for Data Science slack channel has great community support\nCodecademy R course\nR bloggers collates blog posts about R. Some blogs I would recommend checking out are https://www.cedricscherer.com/, https://karaman.is/, https://djnavarro.net/, https://github.com/tashapiro/TidyTuesday, https://www.yan-holtz.com/blog.html, and https://albert-rapp.de/blog.html\nFor data visualisation ggplot2 is the go to tool, and the best way to learn it is to run through this book and using the R graph gallery\nFor getting some open source data to start your own projects I would recommend the tidy Tuesday initiative. All dataset are hosted in github."
